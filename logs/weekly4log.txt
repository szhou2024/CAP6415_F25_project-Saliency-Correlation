Implemented a custom MultiEigenCAM that is basically a modified version of EigenCAM class from grad-cam library. Overrides EigenCAM, going to save weights and PCs by overriding get_cam_image. Added explained variance too, I'm not sure if this will apply but it won't hurt.

Implemented Saliency metrics, a static class of just methods. One issue I realized is that correlation between saliency maps will include 0's, so will inflate correlation. This is standard in research it seems, but I'm going to use cc_mask, which applies a union mask. This gets rid of 0's inflating.

On a side note, realized that scanpath is not a great metric to include in this case, since the implemented model generated CAM map does not involve path dependency in any way (i.e like DeepGaze). Choosing to ignore it.

Implemented the main loop, gave it a test run. All good.

Implemented a backup system just in case things go south due to unexpected RAM overuse or memory leaks. Hasn't been the case thus far.

Did a first run across all images. Across the way, I realized that it's impossible to store CAM objects or outputs from PCA into dictionary. Had to just store output metrics only. The good news is that once keys are stored (they are), we can always generate CAMs through forward pass.

Finalized all 5000 images, stored it into a backup. Going to do a summary and perhaps a slightly depeer dive, since the aggregated centrality metrics are meaningless. Will do the "similarities and differences" analysis.
