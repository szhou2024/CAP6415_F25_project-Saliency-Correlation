Began exploring saliency datasets and formulating ways to conduct experiments.Specifically, the datasets in consideration are the standard CAT2000 and MIT300:

Took a look at the original dataset, including what types of images (20 scenes), resolution (1080p), and test train split (2000 each). Paper below:

Took a look at the Torralba paper to understand CAM process for saliency:
